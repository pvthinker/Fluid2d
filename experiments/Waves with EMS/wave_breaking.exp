# Fluid2d-experiment with EMS: wave breaking at the coast (experiment file)
#
# Refer to the documentation of `ems.parse_experiment_file` for a
# detailed description of the experiment file format.

# Name of the experiment class.
# If the name is changed, a new table is created in the database.
Name: Breaking_Waves


# ID of the experiment within its class.
# Usually, an ID should NOT be specified, so that the EMS chooses automatically a unique ID.
# It is only necessary to specify an ID explicitly if fluid2d runs on multiple cores, for
# example with mpirun.  Furthermore, it is possible to overwrite existing entries in the
# database by specifying their ID.
# The ID is automatically increased by 1 for every new combination if multiple values are
# given for one or several parameters.
# Uncomment the following line to set an ID manually:
#ID: 21


# Descriptions are optional.
# They can go over multiple lines and can also contain empty lines.
# Empty lines at the beginning and at the end of the description are ignored.
Description: Simulate waves on the interface of two fluids.
Modify the parameters in this file and observe the creation, propagation and breaking of waves at a sloping coast.


# Here are the parameters that we want to modify in this class of experiments.
# Parameters which we intend to keep constant are in the Python file.
# For every parameter, at least one value has to be specified.  Multiple values can be
# specified to automatically run one experiment for every combination of the given values.
Parameters:

### Physics
# activate or deactivate diffusion
diffusion False
# diffusion coefficient (if diffusion is True)
Kdiff 1e-2

### Coast
slope 0.5
height 1.05
# beginning of the flat coast
x_start 4.0

### Initial Condition
# perturbation can be of type "sin" or "gauss"
perturbation gauss
# height and width of the perturbation
intensity  0.5
sigma      0.4 0.8
